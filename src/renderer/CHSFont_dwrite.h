// Optional DirectWrite grayscale rasterizer used by CHSFont.
//
// This is an additional rendering backend, NOT a replacement of the GDI
// path: the existing GDI GetGlyphOutlineW pipeline and the stb_truetype
// supplementary-plane path stay untouched. CHSFont picks the backend via
// the [Fonts] TextRenderer key (default "DWrite", fallback "GDI").
//
// Why DirectWrite: it is a Windows system component (dwrite.dll, built into
// Windows 7+), so no third-party dependency (no FreeType) is introduced.
// The engine binds an IDWriteFontFace to the same HDC CHSFont already
// selects fonts into, so the face selection (NormalFonts / SlantFontFile /
// bold check) is reused 100%: DirectWrite renders exactly the font GDI
// would, and the rest of the pipeline (64x64 atlas cells, slot cache, batch
// drawing, surrogate merging) is unchanged. The rasterized glyph is still a
// gray alpha image written as R=G=B=A, identical to the GDI output.
//
// All comments are English on purpose: the project sources are GBK-encoded.

// project-wide types (nil, uint32, uint8) live in common.h; must come first.

// Rasterization result of one codepoint. Placement convention:
//   - The engine draws the glyph into an internal 64x64 DIB whose origin is
//     the CELL TOP-LEFT corner; the baseline origin is placed at y = baseY
//     (the value the caller passes).
//   - left/top are therefore the black box position RELATIVE TO THE CELL
//     TOP-LEFT (both >= 0 for a normally placed glyph; the box is already
//     where the atlas cell wants it).
//   - CHSFont uses: x0 = penX + left  (centers the advance cell then adds
//     the glyph's offset inside it) and  y0 = top  (direct absolute cell
//     row placement - the engine already accounted for the baseline).
